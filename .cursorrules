  tech_stack: [vite-react-ts, tailwindcss, framer-motion, supabase]
  ui:
    enforce_tailwind: true
    enforce_glassmorphic_gradient: true
    use_framer_motion: true
    component_dir: "components"
rules:
  - Always style with Tailwind utility classes; never inline styles or CSS Modules
  - Use Framer Motion for animations (prefer motion.* wrappers and variants)
  - Maintain glassmorphic gradient background on all pages and major surfaces
  - Do not introduce new UI libs without explicit approval
  - Components must be function components with hooks; no class components
  - Strict TypeScript: no any, no implicit any, no ts-ignore
  - Services must validate inputs/outputs with Zod schemas
  - No mocks/demos/placeholders. Implement real behavior or omit feature
  - Keep integrations via `services/*`; do not call third-party APIs from components
  - Tests required for new services and complex components
  - Follow existing file naming conventions and folders
